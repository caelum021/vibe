# vibe

Your window into AI-native coding.

**vibe .** That's all you need.

[한국어 설명 (Korean README)](./README.ko.md)

When AI changes your code, vibe lets you see what happened, review the diff, and edit files to steer direction — all in real time. No debugger, no compiler. Just documents, edits, and context.

## What you can do

**Browse and edit files** — Explore your project as a file tree. Markdown is rendered, code is syntax-highlighted. Edit and save in place.

**See AI changes in real time** — When an AI CLI like Claude Code modifies a file, vibe auto-refreshes. If you're editing, it shows a "changed externally" badge instead of overwriting your work.

**Git diff** — See which files changed with status badges. View diffs inline or side-by-side.

**Project dashboard** — Language breakdown, document groups, and recently changed files at a glance.

**Multiple projects** — Register projects and switch between them with Cmd+1–9.

**Dark mode** — Warm walnut-toned dark theme. Toggle with Ctrl+Shift+L.

## Usage

```bash

vibe .                   # Open current directory
vibe                     # Folder picker dialog
```
