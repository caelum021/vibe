# vibe

**Your window into AI-native coding.**

Run `vibe .` in any project directory. That's all you need.

When AI changes your code, vibe shows you what happened, lets you review the changes, and edit files to steer direction — all in real time. No debugger, no compiler. Just documents, edits, and context.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Download the latest version from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/solpop-arch/vibe/releases).

- **macOS (Apple Silicon)**: `vibe_x.x.x_aarch64.dmg`
- **macOS (Intel)**: `vibe_x.x.x_x64.dmg`
- **Windows**: `vibe_x.x.x_x64-setup.exe`
- **Linux**: `vibe_x.x.x_amd64.AppImage`

On macOS, open the DMG and drag the app to your Applications folder.

## What you can do

**Browse and edit files** — Explore your project as a file tree. Markdown is rendered, code is syntax-highlighted. Edit and save in place.

**See AI changes in real time** — When an AI CLI like Claude Code modifies a file, vibe auto-refreshes. If you're editing, it shows a "changed externally" badge instead of overwriting your work.

**Git diff** — See which files changed with status badges. View diffs inline or side-by-side.

**Project dashboard** — When you open a project, vibe greets you with a dashboard instead of a blank editor. See your codebase at a glance:

- **Project stats** — file count, folder count, language breakdown
- **Documents** — markdown docs in your project root and `docs/` subdirectories, auto-grouped and listed
- **Recently Changed** — last 10 modified files, so you can immediately see what your AI CLI just touched
- **Git status** — current branch and working tree state

This is especially useful when returning to a project after an AI session — you can quickly orient yourself without digging through the file tree.

**Multiple projects** — Register projects and switch between them with Cmd+1–9.

**Dark mode** — Warm walnut-toned dark theme. Toggle with Ctrl+Shift+L.

## Usage

Open the app and pick a folder. Or launch from the terminal:

```bash
vibe /path/to/project    # Open a specific folder
vibe .                   # Open current directory
vibe                     # Folder picker dialog
```
